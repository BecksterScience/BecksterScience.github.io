## About Me
Hello! My name is Evan Beck, and it is a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me—welcome to my website! 

I received my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics from San Diego State University in 2023. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science at the Center for Data Science, NYU. My goal is to complete my Master’s and begin working as a Data Scientist. My main areas of interest are wildlife conservation and climate science. 

In my free time, I enjoy fishing, exploring the outdoors, and spending time with my family. I am the son of two wonderful parents, the brother of three amazing siblings—including a sister, brother, and a dog. I am also a proud dog dad to an incredible pit bull mix rescue! 

My family, friends, and love for the natural world serve as my greatest inspirations. My core values include endless love, acceptance of all, social and political reform, and equality.
